# CheckYoSelf
## Created by Edwin Del Bosque
### Summary
This is the final solo project of Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. CheckYoSelf is a project that focuses on continuing to develop the skills of writing semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS, and DRY JavaScript. This project contains DOM manipulation, a data model, and client-side data persistence using localStorage.

CheckYoSelf is an to-do list web application. Additionally, you can prioritize cards to mark them as important, and check off individual tasks off the card. Once you have created all of your to-do lists, you will be able to filter the displaying cards by importance. The search bar will also allow you search the title of your cards to find exactly what you're looking for.
